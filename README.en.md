[Deployment Documentation](https://github.com/mokeyjay/Pixiv-daily-ranking-widget/blob/master/doc/deploy.en.md)

## üîå APIs
[Ranking data (images hosted privately)](https://pixiv.mokeyjay.com/?r=api/pixiv-json) (recommended)  
[Ranking data (pixiv url)](https://pixiv.mokeyjay.com/?r=api/source-json)

In which `data` is the data of the ranking table; `date` is the date of ranking (could be yesterday or the day before, as the time of refresh on Pixiv is not certain)  

Both APIs automatically return the respective cross-domain header according to `Origin` or `Referer` within the request header. The APIs are front-end ready.

> The `image` and `url` keys are for compatibility purposes for users of 4.x or earlier versions, they can be ignored
